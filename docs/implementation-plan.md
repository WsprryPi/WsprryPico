# Implementation plan

Status: proposed sequence.

## Completed baseline

- Documented the accepted architectural decisions.
- Established draft WTP and browser API boundaries.
- Identified the static PIO divider resolution issue for a representative HF carrier.
- Recorded initial implementation and qualification boundaries; current status
  is detailed below.

## Completed WTP/1 contract

- Defined framing, exact representations, envelopes and operation schemas.
- Defined finite job limits, state transitions, ownership and clock rules.
- Defined retry, replay, reconnect, reset, error and transport behavior.
- Added machine-readable contract data, normative vectors and a dependency-free
  hardware-free validator.

## Completed hardware-free job service

The portable C++20 core now provides bounded frame parsing, SHA-256 replay
identity, typed request dispatch, ownership leases, immutable jobs, clock-aware
arming, lifecycle management, retained results and output-safe cancellation.
Deterministic tests use a virtual clock and mock RF engine.

Host evidence covers partial, malformed and oversized frames, unsupported
versions and modes, duplicate requests and ARM, concurrent owners, late starts,
clock rejection, reconnect/reset behavior, cancellation, output-disable
failure, and local execution without further requests. It is not target or RF
evidence.

## Completed Pico firmware foundation

The Pico SDK, Arm toolchain and picotool inputs are pinned. The Pico 2 W build
links the portable service to an unsynchronized target clock, fresh boot
identity, stable device identity and RF-inhibited engine. Two USB CDC interfaces
separate text diagnostics from bounded WTP framing. CMake presets and VS Code
metadata provide the same repository-root build.

## Completed dual USB CDC transport

Dedicated Console/WTP APIs provide bounded RX/TX, partial-write handling,
connection resets, distinct descriptor identities and deterministic isolation
checks. Hardware USB validation remains separately opt-in.

## Completed strict WTP USB adapter

Strict JSON request decoding, response/event encoding and typed job-service
routing now run on the WTP CDC interface. Connection negotiation, replayed
snapshots, logical closure and bounded ordered transmission are host-tested
against normative fixtures, the independent schema validator and monitor decoder.
An opt-in read-only probe is supplied. Bounded target USB checks pass for the
[recorded board, image and host](development/usb-target-validation.md); general
WTP conformance and RF qualification are not claimed.
See the [endpoint guide](development/wtp-endpoint.md).

## Next slice: RF feasibility and engine selection

Complete the mathematical RF feasibility comparison, select an implementation
candidate and prepare a bounded measurement plan. Keep implementation evidence,
hardware validation and RF qualification separate. No RF authorization follows
from completing the USB endpoint.

Before extracting encoder code, inspect WsprryPi licensing and dependencies and record source revision/attribution. Initial candidate files include src/scheduling.hpp, src/scheduling_runtime.cpp and src/tests/wspr_tone_regression_test.cpp; finding them is not a portability review.

## Subsequent slices

1. Implement and validate an RF engine under separately explicit hardware/RF authorization.
2. Add standalone encoding, station configuration, persistent schedules and device time acquisition. Verify autonomous operation without WsprryPi.
3. Add WsprryPi client integration using the same conformance fixtures; plan changes in that repository independently.
4. Add Wi-Fi/TCP, shared JSON API adapters and embedded browser assets, followed by SoftAP provisioning.
5. Add BLE provisioning/local management with a documented recovery path.
6. Qualify supported engine/mode/band combinations and release WsprryPico-x.y.z.uf2 with reproducible build identity.

Sequence may evolve based on RF feasibility. Standalone operation remains a product requirement even though USB control is the first transport.

## Current boundaries

The firmware builds for Pico 2 W. The portable core and WTP USB endpoint are
host-tested, and bounded target USB validation passes on the recorded Pico 2 W
and Mac. No RF transmission or target timing qualification has occurred.
Target bands and an RF engine remain open. WTP/1 schemas are
normative; changes to them require an explicit protocol-contract revision.
