# Phase 14 qualification results

Status: IN PROGRESS. See the pre-acquisition [plan](phase14-plan.md).
No Phase 14 release support is claimed at this checkpoint.

The initial host baseline passed 155/157 CTest groups. Two known test-harness
failures were reproduced: the extracted capacity-pressure fixture omitted the
production HTTPS authority helper; explicit admission-budget tests mixed their
injected byte boundary with host-ABI allocation occupancy. Repairs preserve
normal allocation-model checks and adjacent-byte refusal cases. Both affected
groups pass after repair. Firmware runtime is unchanged by these repairs.

Initial live inspection matches both Pico USB serials and receiver/GPSDO
identities on wspr5. A runs inhibited source `6c7b14321003`, B runs inhibited
`72d38d505ba2`; both clocks are 150 MHz, schedules disabled and output false.
B retains no owner/job. The older USB-only inventory cannot finish WTP HELLO
on these consumer profiles, because current source deliberately disables USB
WTP for consumer profiles. These timeouts remain private failed inventory
records; ordinary Plain LAN inventory is used next.

Detailed physical results, release-candidate artifact bindings, final board
state, adversarial findings and publication outcome will be appended here.

Before RF acquisition, the operator explicitly clarified that there is no LPF
and that LPF development/application remains their responsibility. The plan
records this scope amendment; no filter development or post-filter qualification
is required to close the firmware campaign. The complete repaired host suite
passes 158/158 groups.


## Receiver method and candidate checkpoint, 2026-10-08

The first independent rebuild differed because MbedTLS diagnostics embedded
absolute build paths via `__FILE__`. Source `144e8e83e598615a3fb98d2646fc64488a36eedb`
normalizes compiler source/build path prefixes. Two fresh 138 MHz builds now
produce identical complete UF2 bytes, SHA-256
`5c0d80c8dd8cef5fcb02d70e8becdb2a677045d31e8fc50db96e96edcab188f6`.
Both boards retain this ordinary RF-capable candidate, consumer Plain LAN,
GP2, divider 1, RAM renderer, GP14 disabled, fixture code disabled and preserved
settings. These are candidates; no release qualification follows from deployment.

The initial complete 80 m WSPR frames decoded on both boards but failed the
historical 0.1 Hz residual screen (A 0.10543 Hz, B 0.14159 Hz). Three consecutive
settling frames on A passed that screen. Those settling captures bind the
preceding candidate source `fecd531`; the subsequent path-normalization change
alters addresses/layout, so current-image affected launch/resource checks remain
required. Initial tones passed. Current-image B has three DFCW3 passes; QRSS3
and FSKCW3 each have three retained screen failures. QRSS envelopes and quiet
tails agree, but the nine-second dash has 0.291-0.325 rad linear phase residual.
FSKCW has 5.028-5.033 Hz separation, 0.3-0.6 ms transition errors and smooth
state drift that exceeds the frozen composite screen. The screen limits remain
unchanged; diagnosis and final dispositions are pending.

A finite GPSDO-only receiver comparison used four eight-second, fixed-tuning
captures at carrier minus/plus 20 kHz in ABBA order, with six one-second phase
fits per capture. It estimates nominal-to-true time scale 1.000001110233
(1.110233 ppm), observed repeatability bound 0.288629 ppm. The separately stated
1 ppb reference accuracy is an engineering assumption, not a certificate.
GPSDO identity/locks were checked; output 1 was returned to its original 10 MHz,
with output 2, output enable, PPS and output levels unchanged. First execution
failed before analysis because the Harness Python import path was omitted;
its capture and restored settings remain retained. The retry passed acquisition.

Method extension recorded before wider acquisition: an optional simultaneous
GPSDO tone at the tested band point minus 40 kHz permits common tuner-offset
subtraction. It does not discipline the Pico. Apply the separately measured
sampling scale to the frequency difference and relative time only, retaining
raw values, bracket checks and uncertainty. This extends measurement context;
it does not change existing operational screening criteria. Absolute UTC onset
and calibrated power/path insertion loss remain outside the demonstrated claim.

Host-only ownership repair locks only the selected board for deployment and
locks the shared receiver for RF/reference batches. All RF jobs still verify
the other board is inactive. Constructor failure and reference restoration
failure release owned handles. The rejected overlapping deployment changed
no board. No firmware runtime change was needed for these automation repairs.
